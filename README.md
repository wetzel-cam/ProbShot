# Probability Shot

### A project inspired by Vsauce 2's video  [*Surviving The Deadliest Two-Player Game*](https://youtu.be/ACtsYN1TWLg)

#### Usage:

Simply run the file using `python probshot.py`. The 'Amount of games' can be any integer value greater than 0 (otherwise it just won't run any games). 'Output games' accepts `True` or `False` (not case-sensitive); this will output the wins from each game to the console. 'Modified game; accepts `True` or `False` (not case-sensitive); this will determine whether the games played will "remove bias" (see video for explanation).

#### Note

Notice the percentage values you get running trials for both regular and modified games and compare it to the percentages in the video.
